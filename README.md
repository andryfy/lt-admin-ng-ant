Angular has been updated more in the past year than in the past few years. The API has many inconsistent writing methods, so the schematic has not been updated in time. Now single is only a developer preview version. In order to ensure production, I have not used it in the ng16 version. I think Wait for the api to be written stably before updating the schematic. If you want to use the schematic I provided, you can only adapt to the ng15 version at present, and use the module instead of the independent component version.
# Project Introduction
1. If you use my project for study or reference, please first determine which version of angular you are using, because some of the writing methods are different after angular15, so my suggestion is, which version of angular are you using, then download the corresponding version For ng-ant-admin, the latest version can be downloaded directly from the master branch, and the historical version can be downloaded from this link [here] (https://github.com/andryfy/lt-admin-ng-ant/releases). <br>

How to use
```
   constructor(private windowsWidthService: WindowsWidthService) {
   }
  
   this.windowsWidthService.getWindowWidthStore().pipe(takeUntil(this.destory$)).subscribe(res => {
     this.currentEquipmentWidth = res;
     this.cdr.markForCheck();
   })

# The temporary statement cycle of switching tab calls is as follows under route reuse (The temporary statement cycle of switching tab calls is as follows)

```typescript
_onReuseInit: () => void;
_onReuseDestroy: () => void;

```
This can be achieved by directly writing a method named _onReuseInit or _onReuseDestroy in the target component<br>
